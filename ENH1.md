To enhance K-ISA with AVX-512 capabilities, we will leverage AVX-512's 512-bit vector registers, which allow us to process 16 elements (assuming 32-bit elements) at a time. This upgrade aligns well with K's array-oriented approach, enabling more efficient vector operations. Below, we outline the necessary modifications and new instructions to incorporate AVX-512 into K-ISA.

### **Vector Register Updates**
- **Previous Design**: Vector registers were 256 bits wide, holding 8 x 32-bit elements.
- **Updated Design**: Vector registers are now 512 bits wide, capable of holding 16 x 32-bit elements.
- **Data Types**: For consistency, we will focus on 32-bit elements (integers or floats), though support for other data types (e.g., 64-bit) could be added later.

### **New Instructions for K-ISA**
We will introduce a set of high-level instructions that take advantage of AVX-512's capabilities. These instructions are designed to be concise, fitting K-ISA's philosophy, and provide building blocks for array-based algorithms.

#### **1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Instructions**
- **`FFT Vd, Vs`**: Computes a 16-point FFT on the source vector `Vs` and stores the result in `Vd`.
  - Suitable for signal processing and other frequency-domain operations.
- **`IFFT Vd, Vs`**: Computes the inverse 16-point FFT on `Vs` and stores the result in `Vd`.
  - Useful for transforming back to the time domain.

#### **2. Sorting Instruction**
- **`SORT Vd, Vs`**: Sorts the 16 elements in `Vs` and stores the sorted result in `Vd`.
  - Implemented using a sorting network for efficiency, given the fixed size of 16 elements.
  - Ideal for small-scale sorting tasks within vectors.

#### **3. Bit-Reversal Permutation**
- **`BITREV Vd, Vs`**: Applies a bit-reversal permutation to the elements of `Vs`, storing the result in `Vd`.
  - Permutes elements based on the bit-reversal of their indices (e.g., index 1 (001) maps to 8 (1000) for 16 elements).
  - Useful as a companion to FFT algorithms, where bit-reversed order is common.

#### **4. General-Purpose Vector Operations**
These instructions provide flexibility for combining operations in various algorithms:

- **`VPERMUTE Vd, Vs, Vp`**: Permutes the elements of `Vs` according to the indices in `Vp`, storing the result in `Vd`.
  - Enables custom reordering or sorting operations.
- **`VREDUCE Rd, Vs, op`**: Applies a reduction operation `op` (e.g., sum, product, max, min) to `Vs`, storing the scalar result in `Rd`.
  - Useful for computing aggregates over vectors.
- **`VSCAN Vd, Vs, op`**: Computes the prefix scan (e.g., prefix sum) of `Vs` using operation `op`, storing the result in `Vd`.
  - Essential for parallel algorithms requiring cumulative operations.

### **Memory Access**
- **Loading and Storing Vectors**: Operations on 512-bit vectors require aligned memory access for efficiency.
  - **`VLOAD Vd, [address]`**: Loads 512 bits (16 elements) from memory into vector register `Vd`.
  - **`VSTORE [address], Vs`**: Stores the contents of vector register `Vs` (512 bits) to memory.

### **Example Usage**
Here are some examples to illustrate how these instructions can be combined for complex operations:

#### **Example 1: Compute FFT and Sort Magnitudes**
```plaintext
VLOAD V0, [address]    ; Load 16 elements from memory into V0
FFT V1, V0             ; Compute FFT of V0, store result in V1
VABS V2, V1            ; Compute absolute values (magnitudes), store in V2
SORT V3, V2            ; Sort the magnitudes, store in V3
VSTORE [address], V3   ; Store sorted magnitudes back to memory
```

#### **Example 2: Compute Cumulative Sum**
```plaintext
VLOAD V0, [address]    ; Load 16 elements into V0
VSCAN V1, V0, ADD      ; Compute prefix sum of V0, store in V1
VSTORE [address], V1   ; Store cumulative sum back to memory
```

### **Implementation Considerations**
- **AVX-512 Mapping**: These instructions can be implemented using AVX-512 intrinsics or assembly, leveraging features such as:
  - Wide 512-bit registers for vector operations.
  - Fused multiply-add instructions for FFT.
  - Gather/scatter instructions for permuting or placing elements.
  - Prefix sum operations for `VSCAN`.
- **Hardware vs. Software**: K-ISA instructions can be translated to sequences of x86 AVX-512 instructions if implemented on an x86 processor, or directly supported in custom hardware designed for K-ISA.
- **Masking (Optional)**: AVX-512 supports masked operations for conditional execution. While not included in the current design for simplicity, masking could be added for more flexibility.

### **Summary**
By upgrading K-ISA to leverage AVX-512, we enhance its vector processing capabilities, aligning with K's array-oriented philosophy. The new instructions (`FFT`, `IFFT`, `SORT`, `BITREV`, `VPERMUTE`, `VREDUCE`, `VSCAN`) provide powerful tools for array manipulation, enabling efficient computation on 16-element vectors using 512-bit registers. These instructions can be combined flexibly to implement various algorithms, maintaining conciseness and efficiency.
